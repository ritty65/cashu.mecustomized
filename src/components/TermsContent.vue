      between you and those third parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important Notice (Mediation-First).</strong> These Terms require
      mediation before arbitration or litigation. Please read carefully. If you
      do not agree, do not use Fundstr.

    <h2>1) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>2) Nature of the Services (Non-Custodial; Client-Side Only)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>2.1 Client-Side Execution.</strong> The Application executes
      entirely on your device. We do not custody, control, access, transfer,
      freeze, reverse, or restore any ecash, secrets, or keys and have no
      ability to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.2 No Mint Control or Endorsement.</strong> We neither operate
      nor control any Mint and do not vet, endorse, or monitor Mints. Your
      choice to interact with a Mint is solely between you and that Mint.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.3 No Regulated Financial Services.</strong> We do not provide
      payment services, e-money, banking, exchange, remittance, brokerage,
      investment, or any regulated financial service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.4 Open-Source; Third-Party Instances.</strong> The code may be
      self-hosted by others. We are not responsible for any third-party instance
      or fork; use of such instances is at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.5 No Duty to Update or Support.</strong> We may modify, disable,
      or discontinue the Site or any feature at any time, with no obligation to
      provide updates, patches, or support.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.6 Experimental Software.</strong> The Application is
      experimental and may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or incompatibilities.
    </p>

    <h2>3) Your Responsibilities &amp; Assumption of Risk</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>3.1 Sole Responsibility.</strong> You use the Services at your own
      risk and for your own account. You alone are responsible for selecting
      Mints, conducting transactions, and safeguarding ecash and secret values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3.2 No Partnership with Mints.</strong> We are not affiliated
      with, endorsed by, or responsible for any Mint. No agency, partnership, or
      joint venture is formed by your use of the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3.3 Self-Custody &amp; Key Management.</strong> Loss of your
      device, secrets, or backups may result in permanent loss of access to
      ecash. We cannot recover or reissue ecash.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3.4 Protocol/Network Risks.</strong> You accept risks arising from
      protocol changes, implementation bugs, network congestion or outages, fee
      volatility, adversarial Mints, and irreversible transfers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3.5 Taxes &amp; Reporting.</strong> You are solely responsible for
      any tax determination, reporting, and payment related to your use of ecash
      or Mints.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Compliance with Laws; Sanctions &amp; Export</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>4.1 Your Legal Compliance.</strong> Your use is void where
      prohibited. You must ensure your activities are lawful where you live or
      access the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4.2 No Regulated Services by Us.</strong> The Services are not
      intended to constitute regulated financial, banking, e-money, or payment
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4.3 Sanctions, Export Controls, Restricted Jurisdictions.</strong>
      You represent and warrant that you are not (a) located in, ordinarily
      resident in, or accessing the Services from any jurisdiction embargoed or
      comprehensively sanctioned by the EU, UK, or US; (b) on any EU/UK/US
      sanctions or restricted-party list; or (c) using the Services for any
      prohibited end use under applicable export-control laws. We may geo-block
      or restrict access where we reasonably believe use would be unlawful.
    </p>

    <h2>5) License &amp; Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>5.1 Site License.</strong> Subject to these Terms, we grant you a
      revocable, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access the
      Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5.2 Open-Source Code.</strong> The Application code is licensed
      under its open-source license (e.g., MIT/Apache-2.0—see the repository).
      That license, not these Terms, governs your rights in the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5.3 Feedback License.</strong> You grant us a perpetual,
      worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify,
      and sublicense any suggestions or feedback you provide, with no obligation
      to attribute or compensate you.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Privacy &amp; Data</h2>
    <p>
      <em
        >Privacy note (safer than “no logs”). We do not intentionally collect
        personal data. Our hosting/CDN/security providers may temporarily
        process IP addresses and request metadata to deliver and protect the
        Site; we instruct them to minimize retention.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.1 Data-Minimizing Design.</strong> The Application runs locally
      and is designed to avoid sending personal data to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.2 Hosting/CDN Logs.</strong> Third-party hosting/CDN/security
      providers used to serve the Site may process transient IP addresses and
      basic request metadata for delivery and security. We instruct such
      providers to minimize retention where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.3 Local Storage.</strong> Any state created by the Application
      (e.g., browser storage) is under your control on your device. Clearing
      storage can permanently remove access to Application state.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.4 Third-Party Links/Instances.</strong> Third-party sites or
      self-hosted instances have their own privacy practices, for which we are
      not responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.5 Separate Privacy Notice.</strong> A concise Privacy Notice
      consistent with this §6 may be provided and is incorporated by reference.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Availability; Beta; Support</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>7.1 Availability Not Guaranteed.</strong> The Site may experience
      downtime, maintenance windows, or disruptions. We provide no SLA.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.2 Beta/Experimental Features.</strong> Features may be labeled
      “beta,” “experimental,” or similar and may change or be removed at any
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.3 Support.</strong> We may provide community or documentation
      support at our discretion; no obligation arises.

      You may not use the Services to: (a) violate any law (including AML/CTF);
      (b) engage in fraud, scams, or illicit finance; (c) interfere with or
      disrupt the Site; (d) target high-risk environments (e.g., life support,
      critical infrastructure) where failure could cause death or severe harm;
      or (e) reverse-engineer, scrape, or extract source in violation of
      applicable licenses.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates,
      officers, employees, and contributors from any claims, damages,
      liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
      arising from: (a) your use of the Services, (b) your interactions with any
      Mint, or (c) your violation of these Terms or law.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>10.1 No Warranties.</strong> THE SITE AND APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED
      “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
      IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
      TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.2 No Liability for Mints/Third Parties.</strong> We are not
      responsible for Mints, networks, third-party software, or self-hosted
      instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.3 Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
      PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE
      GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID US (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE
      THE CLAIM AROSE OR (B) €50.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.4 Exclusion of Damages.</strong> WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, ENHANCED, OR
      PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL; OR COST OF
      SUBSTITUTE GOODS/SERVICES—even if advised of the possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.5 Time-Bar.</strong> ANY CLAIM MUST BE FILED WITHIN 12 MONTHS
      after it arose or be forever barred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.6 Consumer Rights.</strong> Nothing here limits non-waivable
      statutory consumer rights (including in the EU/EEA).
    </p>

    <h2>
      11) Dispute Resolution (Mediation → Arbitration); Governing Law &amp;
      Forum
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>11.1 Governing Law &amp; Forum.</strong> These Terms are governed
      by the laws of Spain, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. The
      exclusive forum/seat for disputes is Madrid, Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.2 Mediation First.</strong> Before arbitration or litigation,
      the parties will attempt good-faith mediation with a reputable provider.
      Each party bears its own costs; mediator fees are shared equally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.3 Arbitration; Class-Action Waiver.</strong> If unresolved
      after 30 days of mediation (or a mutually agreed period), disputes will be
      settled by final, binding arbitration on an individual basis under the
      rules of CIAM (Corte Internacional de Arbitraje de Madrid), seat Madrid,
      language English. CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS ARE WAIVED to the maximum
      extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.4 Small-Claims Carve-Out.</strong> Either party may bring an
      individual claim in a competent small-claims court in Madrid (if
      available) for disputes within that court’s jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.5 EU Consumers.</strong> Mandatory EU/EEA consumer dispute
      entitlements remain unaffected where they cannot be waived.
    </p>

    <h2>12) DMCA / Notice-and-Takedown</h2>
    <p>
      If you believe content on the Site infringes your rights, send a notice to
      [legal@fundstr.[●]] with: (a) identification of the work, (b) the
      allegedly infringing material and its location, (c) your contact info, (d)
      a statement of good-faith belief, and (e) a statement under penalty of
      perjury that the information is accurate and you are authorized to act. We
      may remove content or disable access at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>13) Security; Responsible Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      Report suspected vulnerabilities to [security@fundstr.[●]]. Do not
      publicly disclose before we have a reasonable opportunity to investigate
      and remediate. Accessing data without authorization, privacy violations,
      or service disruption is prohibited.
    </p>

    <h2>14) Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access immediately for any reason, including
      policy violations, legal risk, or operational/security concerns. Upon
      termination, your license to access the Site ends, but provisions that by
      their nature should survive (including Indemnity, Disclaimers, Liability
      Limits, Dispute Resolution, Feedback License) survive termination.
    </p>

    <h2>15) Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify these Terms at any time by posting an updated version with a
      new “Last Updated” date. Material changes will be flagged reasonably in
      advance where legally required (e.g., EU consumer law). Your continued use
      after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
    </p>

    <h2>16) No Investment, Legal, or Tax Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Fundstr does not provide investment, legal, or tax advice. No fiduciary,
      advisory, or trust relationship is formed by your use of the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>17) Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>
      We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our
      reasonable control (including acts of God, labor disputes, utility
      failures, cyberattacks, or government action).
    </p>

    <h2>18) Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
    <p>
      You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may
      assign freely. No third party has rights under these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>19) Severability; No Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. No
      failure or delay to exercise any right constitutes a waiver.
    </p>

    <h2>20) Electronic Communications &amp; E-Sign Consent</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Services, you consent to receive communications
      electronically and agree that electronic agreements and signatures satisfy
      legal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>21) Risk Disclosure Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Using ecash involves significant risks including legal, market, liquidity,
      counterparty, and operational risks. You acknowledge and accept these
      risks and agree to review any Risk Disclosure we publish from time to
      time.
    </p>

    <h2>22) Language &amp; Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      We may provide translations for convenience; the English version controls
      in case of conflict (unless local law mandates otherwise). Headings are
      for convenience only.
    </p>

    <h2>23) Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms (together with any open-source licenses applicable to the code
      and any posted policies referenced herein) are the entire agreement
      between you and Fundstr regarding the Site/Services.
